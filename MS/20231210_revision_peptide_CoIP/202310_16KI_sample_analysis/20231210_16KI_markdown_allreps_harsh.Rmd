#filter_missval filters a proteomics dataset based on missing values.
#The dataset is filtered for proteins that have a maximum of ’thr’ missing values in at least one condition.

#IF filter for proteins that are identified in all replicates of at least one condition:
data_filt <- filter_missval(data_se, thr = 0)

# OR FOR Less stringent filtering:
#Filter for proteins that are identified in 3 out of 6 replicates of at least one condition
#data_filt <- filter_missval(data_se, thr = 3)


#After filtering, the number of identified proteins per sample can be plotted as well as the overlap in identifications between samples.

# Plot a barplot of the number of identified proteins per samples

# Plot a barplot of the protein identification overlap between samples

# Test normalization of data and decide with plot whether to use it
```{r norm}
#The data is background corrected and normalized by variance stabilizing transformation (vsn).

# Normalize the data
#data_norm <- normalize_vsn(data_filt)
#The normalization can be inspected by checking the distributions of the samples before and after normalization.
#normalization did nto work for such a small sample number so leave out
# Visualize normalization by boxplots for all samples before and after normalization
#plot_normalization(data_filt, data_norm)

```

# WITHOUT normalization
## Imputation 
```{r imp}
#Plot a heatmap of proteins with missing values
plot_missval(data_filt)

# Plot intensity distributions and cumulative fraction of proteins with and without missing values
plot_detect(data_filt)


data_imp <- impute(data_filt, fun = "min") #without norm, if want norm, need to impute "data_norm"

# if want a different method, all possible imputation methods are printed in an error, if an invalid function name is given.
#impute(data_filt, fun = "")
#more explanation: https://rdrr.io/bioc/MSnbase/man/impute-methods.html
